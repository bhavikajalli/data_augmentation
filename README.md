#audio_classification:

The classification program uses 7 features to make a decision. These features include the Mel,Chroma, Mfcc,tempo,beats, tonnetz and contrast. I have used the librosa library to extract the features. The link to the library is as follows: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/librosa/librosa/blob/master/examples/LibROSA%20demo.ipynb

I have used the Random Forrest Classifier.


# data_augmentation

The attached code was used to create virtual images for detecting and classifying traffic light using YOLOv2.
